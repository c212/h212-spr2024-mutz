In the land of maple syrup and snow, Where moose and beavers freely go, A curious notion began to brew, A declaration of war, yes, it’s true!

The Grinch, that sly old fellow, Whispered secrets to the marshmallow, “Let’s march to Canada,” he said with glee, “To claim their poutine and hockey spree!”

The Lorax, with his bushy mustache, Stood up tall, ready to clash, “War is not the answer,” he cried, “Let’s plant trees instead, far and wide!”

But the Cat in the Hat, oh so sly, Waved his striped hat, reaching for the sky, “War can be fun,” he merrily chimed, “Let’s play snowball fights, one at a time!”
